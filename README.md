## About Huey
Welcome to Huey — an open source colour picker app for Windows, in development with WPF and .NET. Unlike many colour pickers that are only available as browser extensions, Huey is planned as a full-featured desktop application. This project was started because I couldn’t find a modern, standalone colour picker, and I wanted to learn C# and WPF by building something useful for the community. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
